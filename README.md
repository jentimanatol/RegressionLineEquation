## 🧾 About This Project

This application was created as part of my personal portfolio to demonstrate my ability to design clean, functional, and mathematically-accurate software tools for data analysis and education perfect for Statistics I MAT-181.

**Critical r-value Calculator & Visualizer** is more than just a calculator — it's a learning assistant. Designed for both beginners and professionals in statistics, the app simplifies complex statistical formulas into an interactive, visual experience. It reflects my interests in:

* Applied statistics
* GUI design and usability
* Data-driven decision-making
* Clear scientific communication

This project showcases my proficiency in **Python 3**, **Tkinter**, **matplotlib**, and statistical logic implementation, while focusing on clean UX principles and code modularity.

## 🚀 Features Overview

* 🔢 **Instant r-value calculation** using input α and sample size
* 📈 **Live plot visualization** of r\_critical values vs. sample size
* 💾 **Save your graph** as PNG — perfect for academic reports
* 📘 **Transparent formula explanations** with each result
* 🎨 **User-friendly GUI**, optimized for clarity and focus

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Who Should Use This?

This app is tailored for:

* 📚 **Students** learning statistical significance and hypothesis testing
* 🧪 **Researchers** working with correlation coefficients
* 👩‍🏫 **Teachers & professors** explaining r-value thresholds
* 📊 **Data analysts** validating correlation strength in datasets

Whenever you're working with **Pearson correlation coefficients**, it’s critical to assess whether your r-value is statistically significant. This app helps **demystify that threshold** and lets you explore how it evolves with varying sample sizes and confidence levels.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Enter Significance Level (α)**
   Example: `0.05` (which represents 95% confidence)

2. **Enter Sample Size (n)**
   Must be `3` or more (e.g., `14`, `25`, `100`)

3. **Click “Calculate & Plot”**
   The app will generate:

   * Critical r-value (both positive and negative)
   * Degrees of freedom and t-critical value
   * Formula explanation
   * A plot showing r\_critical as n increases

4. **Click “💾 Save Plot”**
   Instantly export the chart as a `.png` file for documentation or presentations.

## 🧠 Core Mathematical Concepts

```txt
Degrees of Freedom (df): df = n - 2  
t-critical:               Two-tailed t-distribution at chosen α  
r-critical formula:       r = t / √(t² + df)
```

All calculations follow standard statistical principles and are dynamically updated based on input.

## 💡 Why I Built This

I created this project to bridge the gap between **theory and practice** in statistics. Too often, critical values are memorized or looked up in tables without true understanding. This tool encourages **exploration and experimentation**, helping users develop an intuitive grasp of how significance thresholds behave.

As a passionate learner and problem solver, I wanted to combine **statistical precision**, **code elegance**, and **accessibility** — all wrapped in a simple executable anyone can use.
